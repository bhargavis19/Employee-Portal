# Employee-Portal

## Project Overview

The Employee Portal is a centralized platform that serves as a unified interface, integrating various departmental tools, applications, and essential resources. Designed with a focus on ease of navigation, usability, and a modern look, this portal improves the user experience by organizing applications into clearly defined categories, making it easy for employees to locate and access the tools they need.

## Features

1. **Home (Index) Page**: 
   - Displays various application categories, with each application neatly organized under its respective category.
   - A fully responsive layout ensures seamless functionality across all screen sizes.
   - All applications are visible on a single screen, reducing the need for extensive scrolling with the help of carousel.
   - **Toggle Search Bar**: Allows employees to manually search for applications across all categories. The search bar can be toggled to show or hide as needed.
   - **Holiday Calendar**: Highlights upcoming holidays based on a CSV file. Hovering over a date shows event details, and the calendar updates automatically when the CSV file is modified.

2. **Contacts & Support Page**:
   - A dedicated page for contact and support information, providing employees with easy access to assistance.

3. **Admin Pages**:
   - **Application Management**: An admin page for adding new applications to the portal, with options for specifying application details such as name, link, description, image, and category.
   - **HR Updates**: An HR admin page for uploading updates. Updates are stored in the CSV file and displayed on the frontend for employees.
   - **Access Request Page**: A page for employees to request access to specific applications.
